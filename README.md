# ChatApplication

A **Chat Application** is a desktop software that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. This application is written in **Java** and uses the **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** technology, which makes it a distributed application.

The chat application has two main features: **group chat** and **personal chat**. Group chat allows users to communicate with each other in a shared virtual space, where everyone who is currently using the application can participate. On the other hand, personal chat allows users to communicate with each other privately, in a one-on-one conversation.

The front-end of the chat application is made using the **Java Swing** framework. This allows the developers to create a graphical user interface (GUI) with various components such as buttons, text fields, and labels. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, so that even users with little to no experience with chat applications can use it with ease.

The application uses the **RMI** technology to allow communication between the different instances of the chat application running on different computers. The RMI technology allows the objects in different Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) to invoke methods on each other as if they were local. This enables the chat application to be distributed, meaning that it can be used by people from different locations, as long as they have an active internet connection.

In summary, the **Chat Application** is a distributed desktop software that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. It is written in Java, uses the RMI technology, and has a front-end made using the Java Swing framework.
